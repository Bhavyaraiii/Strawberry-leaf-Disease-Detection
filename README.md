# Strawberry-leaf-Disease-Detection
This project focuses on strawberry plant analysis using machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Image-based deep learning techniques are applied to identify leaf conditions and detect diseases or disorders, supporting early diagnosis and improved crop management in precision agriculture.
